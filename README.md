# Welcome to my React Google Books Search!

Here, you can search for any book through the Google Books API. You can then choose to save your books to your collection, and from there you can delete them if you no longer want them. 

This application was built using the MERN FUll Stack with React.js. It's my first Full Stack app using React.js and I learned a lot about the process of building an interface.
